# Grust GQL/Cypher — Profile Statement

This is the precise, backed statement of Grust's own GQL/Cypher feature catalog.
It began as the terminal deliverable of the GQL completion goal (U16) with
`Full39075` as a candidate internal profile. The completion goal
(`docs/GQL_FULL39075_GOAL.md`, F1–F11) implemented every remaining catalogued
feature, so **`Full39075` is the realized Grust profile**, backed
feature-by-feature against the machine-readable manifest
(`grust_cypher::gql::feature_manifest`), not by prose.

The profile name does **not** claim complete ISO/IEC 39075 conformance, formal
certification, or uniform execution on every backend. The manifest is a scoped
Grust catalog, and the reference executor, pushdown engines, native escape
hatches, and storage adapters have intentionally different capabilities.

**Source of truth:** the `GqlFeature` manifest in `crates/grust-cypher/src/gql.rs`.
This document must agree with it; the test `gql::tests::full_profile_claim_is_backed`
fails if the scoped-out set below drifts from the manifest.

## Profiles (nested)

`GqlConformanceProfile`, narrowest → widest:

1. **StrictWrite** — the original strict writable-Cypher surface (the 327-test
   floor): explicit-id `CREATE`/`MERGE`/`DELETE`/`SET`/`REMOVE`, resolved-endpoint
   edge writes, literal-only assignments, structured rejections.
2. **PortableGql** — StrictWrite **plus** the portable read core, expression
   engine, aggregates/`RETURN`, read pushdown, the type-system values, procedures,
   `CALL { … }` subqueries, transaction surface, and the U10b write widenings.
3. **Full39075** — the widest Grust catalog profile: PortableGql **plus** index and
   graph-type DDL metadata, catalog metadata, named graph selection, session
   control, first-class path and graph values, table-valued functions,
   shortest-path matching, and backend-native passthrough. **This is the
   realized profile today.**

## Realized profile (today): Full39075

**72 of 77 Grust-catalogued features are `Supported`** (implemented + tested); the
remaining 5 are intentional rejections. By family (run `support_summary()` for
the live list): parser/semantics, resolved writes, broad matched writes,
row-producing relationship writes, returning & aggregates, predicates &
expressions (incl. the list binding forms `reduce`, list comprehensions and
general `any`/`all`/`none`/`single`, evaluated by the reference; pushdown
declines them), read-only matching, path matching (incl. `shortestPath` /
`allShortestPaths`), query composition (incl. `CALL { … }` subqueries), type
system (temporal/duration/decimal/path/graph incl. arithmetic, ordering, and
stable serialization where applicable), constraints and index metadata, graph
type metadata, catalog metadata, named graph selection, transactions (control
surface, capability reporting, and atomic batch execution on transactional
stores), session state commands, catalog procedures and
table-valued functions, backend-native passthrough.

Counts: **supported 72 · rejected 5 · planned 0 · future 0 · total 77.**

## Scoped OUT of the profile: intentional rejections (5)

These are the *only* non-`Supported` manifest entries. They are *required*
rejections in the strict surface (pinned by tests) — correctness guards, not
missing features:

- `reject-create-node-without-explicit-identity` (unless `GenerateForCreate`)
- `reject-merge-without-explicit-identity`
- `reject-unresolved-edge-endpoint-write`
- `reject-non-literal-assignment-value`
- `reject-trailing-node-creation-after-row-producing-edge`

## How the claim is backed

- **Manifest** — every feature has a status + min-profile + summary; `is_supported_in`
  drives profile membership.
- **`full_profile_claim_is_backed`** — pins the scoped-out set (exactly the five
  rejections) to this document.
- **Conformance corpora** — `tests/gql/portable_read.json`, `tests/golden/write_golden.json`
  (byte-identical write plans), `tests/golden/write_corpus.json`, plus the
  `grust-turso` differential read-pushdown oracle.
- **Test floor** — the current `grust-cypher` library and integration suites
  must stay green; the original 327 strict-write cases remain a historical
  non-regression floor.

## Honest scope notes (within `Supported`)

The realized profile claims exactly what the summaries in the manifest say, no
more. It is not an exhaustive clause-by-clause model of the ISO standard.
Notable deliberate scopings:

- `CALL { … }` subqueries use correlated **import-all** scoping (the subquery
  sees the outer row's bindings); `RETURN *` inside a subquery is a structured
  rejection.
- `shortestPath` / `allShortestPaths` cover a single relationship segment over
  minimal-length **simple** paths.
- Index/graph-type DDL and catalog metadata are portable, caller-owned
  **metadata**; physical/native index creation remains backend-specific and is
  reported through backend capability flags.
- Native passthrough (`NativeQuery`) is an explicit escape hatch **outside**
  portable conformance: no portable semantics are claimed for passthrough text.

## Per-backend conformance

The executing-Cypher set is **Memory** (reference), **Sail** (writes + read
pushdown), **Turso** (writes + read pushdown + the differential oracle), and
**PostgreSQL** (writes incl. atomic transaction batches + read pushdown over
the universal tables, proven by the gated live differential suite —
`grust-postgres-core/tests/pg_cypher_live.rs`, run with a reachable
PostgreSQL via `GRUST_PG_URL`). The pushed read subset
(see `docs/GQL_PUSHDOWN2_GOAL.md`) covers node/segment/var-length patterns,
`UNION`, `OPTIONAL MATCH`, multi-pattern `MATCH`, the `WITH` horizon, catalog
procedures, TVF row sources, `CALL { … }` subqueries (uncorrelated and
correlated-`WHERE`), and endpoint-only shortest paths — with SQLite-gated
leaves falling back to the reference on Spark, and the `RETURN` projection
always running through the shared reference so pushed results match it by
construction. Postgres-PGQ wraps the
executing Postgres core store but does not yet delegate the executor surface;
**Falkor** and **Surreal**
are native-graph backends (backend-native Cypher / SurrealQL passthrough via
`run_native_cypher` / `run_native_surrealql`); Helix/Ladybug are internal
(`publish=false`); CocoIndex is a sync target. See `GqlBackend::descriptor()`
and `backend_manifest()` for the honest per-backend capability flags (including
`native_passthrough` languages and the W3 cross-variable correlated update,
which only the Memory reference executes).
