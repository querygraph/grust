//! GQL conformance spine (Unit 1 of `docs/GQL_GOAL.md`).
//!
//! This module is the standard-shaped control surface for Grust's path from the
//! current strict writable Cypher subset toward ISO/IEC 39075:2024 GQL. It owns:
//!
//! - [`GqlConformanceProfile`]: the named profiles (strict write, portable GQL,
//!   full ISO/IEC 39075).
//! - [`GqlFeature`] + [`GqlFeatureFamily`] + [`GqlFeatureStatus`]: a feature
//!   taxonomy with stable string identifiers, mapping each cataloged feature to
//!   a family, its current implementation status, the lowest profile that
//!   includes it, and a one-line summary.
//! - [`feature_manifest`] and [`support_summary`]: a generated, machine- and
//!   human-readable report of what Grust supports, rejects, plans, or defers.
//! - [`GqlError`] + [`GqlErrorKind`] and the `gql_*` constructors: feature-tagged
//!   structured errors that name the feature family and conformance level, while
//!   still flowing through the existing `grust_core::Result` plumbing.
//! - [`GqlManifestCase`] and [`load_manifest_cases`]: test-case metadata for the
//!   conformance corpus under `crates/grust-cypher/tests/gql/`.
//!
//! Scope note: Unit 1 establishes the spine and the manifest. Re-routing the
//! existing call sites (which today raise the legacy `GrustError::Cypher*`
//! variants via the `cypher_syntax`/`cypher_unresolved_identity`/
//! `cypher_unsupported_cardinality` helpers) onto feature-tagged `gql_*` errors
//! happens in Unit 4, when the typed-AST + semantic-analysis path lands. The
//! legacy helpers and their error variants are preserved unchanged here so the
//! existing 327 tests keep passing.
